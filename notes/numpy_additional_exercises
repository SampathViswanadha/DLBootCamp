- Consider a large matrix of which a lot of entries are zero. To
  preserve memory, such an array is stored as [r,c,v] where r is row
  index, c is column index, v is value.
  
  1. Create efficient routines for converting between this and normal
  numpy format.
  
  2. Clearly such representation will also be helpful for matrix
  multiplication, as the zeros simply are not there. Create routines for
  a) Matrix addition
  b) Matrix multiplication with another matrix or a vector
  
  For your purposes, generate an array with random data which is only 1%
  full.
  
  After that use the moviedata.mat which is a matlab file present in the
  directory. Search on the internet on how to open that.
  


- Consider some text data, say a long file. Write a function which
  "preprocesses" the file, that is:
  1. It removes punctuation from the file.
  2. Converts all words to lowercase.
  3. Indexes all words with an integer.
  
  After that do an analysis of the text to find out.
  1. Top 100 most common words.
  2. 1% least common words.
  3. Plot a histogram of all the words.
  
  You should use a dictionary object for words and numpy arrays for the
  analysis.
